    <h2>Details about the project</h2>
    <li>Created from scratch using no libaries.</li>
    <li>Persistance managed by a Postgres database</li>
    <li>Allows users to play to hop into previous unfinished games</li>
    <li>Allows players to rewind their moves.</li>
    <h2>Rules of Checkers</h2>
    <li>Red Moves First</li>
    <li>Pieces can only move on the diagonals</li>
    <li>Red pawns can only move on the up diagonals and black on the down diagonals</li>
    <li>You must capture all of your opponents pieces in order to win</li>
    <li>A player captures pieces by hopping over their opponents piece onto an empty tile in the direction they're permitted to travel</li>
    <li>Upon reaching the opposite side of their origin, pawns become "kings" and my travel on all four diagonals</li>
    <li>Upon capturing an opponent, if an immediate opportunity for the piece to continue capturing is present, the subsequent capture must occur.</li>
